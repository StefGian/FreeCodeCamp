      <header>What is “vector graphics”?</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          In contrast to raster (“bitmap”) graphics editors such as Photoshop or GIMP, Inkscape stores its graphics in a
          vector format. Vector graphics is a resolution-independent description of the actual shapes and objects that
          you see in the image. A rasterization engine uses this information to determine how to plot each line and
          curve at any resolution or zoom level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contrast that to raster ("bitmap") graphics, which is always bound to a specific resolution, and stores an
          image as a grid of pixels.

          Vector graphics are a complement, rather than an alternative, to raster graphics. Each has its own purpose and
          is useful for different kinds of things. Raster graphics tend to be better for photographs and some kinds of
          artistic drawings, while vectors are more suitable for design compositions, logos, images with text, technical
          illustrations, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that Inkscape can import and display raster images, too. An imported raster images becomes yet another
          object in your vector graphics, and you can do with it everything you can do to other kinds of objects (move,
          transform, clip, etc.).

      <header>What is “Scalable Vector Graphics”? </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an open, industry-standard XML-based format for vector graphics developed by
          the W3C. Its acceptance has grown fast! Most, if not all, vector editors can import and export SVG, and all
          modern browsers (including IE, starting with IE9) can display it directly, i.e. without requiring any plugins.
          For more information, see About SVG below.

            Emphasis on a small core and extensibility. Extensions should be first-class citizens, so we can say "no" to
            features in the core without guilt.

      <header>Inkscape SVG vs. Plain SVG</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Inkscape's default mode when saving
          conforms to the SVG standard which permits extensions like those outlined here
          Inkscape SVG should render identically with or without the Inkscape extensions
          gives Inkscape hints how to treat things in the UI -- for example, whether to treat a given group as a layer,
          or whether path nodes are cusp/flat/whatever
          seems to have a smaller filesize vs "PlainSVG" for some odd reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Saving document as 'plain SVG' actually invokes exporter. All objects will be reconstructed from parsed data,
          but overall object hierarchy will be preserved." -- quote from the documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          From one perspective, Inkscape SVG is basically the same as plain SVG, just with a few extra commands (in
          separate namespaces) added, which the Inkscape tools use to keep track of their work
          if you edit an inkscape SVG in any other SVG editor, then it should appear as any other plain SVG, if not,
          then you can safely remove all references to inkscape: or sodipodi:, and just be left with the plain SVG
          however, if you then re-edit the SVG in Inkscape (after hand editing, for example) 'without' removing the
          references to inkscape in the object that has been edited (for an example if you edit a path created using the
          inkscape star tool), then inkscape will re-generate the SVG path d="" attributes using the information that
          'it' has stored under its namespace, and therefore getting rid of any editing to the path of that you, the
          user have done.

      <header>Installing fonts</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Inkscape does not require (or offer) any specific way of installing fonts. Essentially, one has to download
          whatever fonts one would like and place them in the default font directory. Many Linux distributions and other
          operating systems will allow to install a font by double-clicking on the file, which will then install/copy
          the font into the correct directory for you.

          If your operating system does not offer this comfortable way of installing fonts, these hints may help you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            On Linux, fonts can be made available systemwide, to be accessible to core GUI resources such as KDE or
            GNOME. More commonly, users only install fonts so they can be used by product-making applications including
            Inkscape and OpenOffice.org.
          </li>
          <li>
            Truetype fonts are installed by placement of the files into the /usr/share/fonts/ttf directory (or
            C:\WINDOWS\FONTS for Windows types).<code>- mv ~/downloads/*.ttf /usr/share/fonts/ttf</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            It is advisable that the font cache file be deleted in the process. This file is fonts.cache-1, located in
            /usr/share/fonts (or C:\WINDOWS\FONTS for Windows types). After font files have been transferred to the
            default font directory, delete this fonts.cache-1 file and the .fonts.cache-1 file in your home directory
            (or "My Documents" directory for Windows types).
            <code>- rm -f /usr/share/fonts/*fonts.cache-1</code>
            <code>- rm -f ~/*fonts.cache-1</code>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once done doing this, you need to rebuild your font cache files (only if you are using Linux or some other OS
          for which font caches are used) so other programs can effectively use the fonts. Do this by going to your
          default font directory (/usr/share/fonts) and typing as root:
        </p>
        <code>- fc-cache</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="save">
      <header>Emergency Save</header>
      <p>
        When Inkscape crashes, it tries to save the document as a backup with following name:
      </p>
      <code>
        <filename>.<datetime>.#
      </code>
      <p>
        If the document has not been saved yet, the name is:
      </p>
      <code>inkscape-emergency.<datetime>.#</code>
      <p>
        Note, that there is no .svg file name ending.
      </p>
      <h4>On Unix (Linux, Mac OS X, *BSD, etc.)</h4>
      <p>
        Inkscape tries to save in the following paths:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Home directory<code>(~/, $HOME, /home/<username>/)</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>/tmp/</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          In the current working directory
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>On Windows</h4>
      <p>
        Inkscape tries to save in %UserProfile%:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          XP/2003: <code>C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Vista/7: <code>C:\Users\<username>\</code>

      <header>How to open EPS files in Windows</header>
      <p>
        Initially you need to find out where ps2pdf is on your machine or install it. It's in the Ghostscript lib
        directory, which is probably something like :
      </p>
      <code>C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.09\lib</code>
      <p>
        If it is not installed you may find a current release of Ghostscript for Windows on their download page here.

        Then you need to add this to the system Path in Environment Variables:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In Win XP, Vista or 7, navigate to the Start button > Control Panel > System > Advanced > Environment
          Variables. Scroll through the System variables in the bottom panel, and select Path, click Edit. In the
          ridiculously small edit box provided, add a semicolon to the end of whatever is there at the moment, and then
          add <code>C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.16\lib</code> (or whatever it is on your machine). Note — There should be no
          space between the semicolon and C (the start of the path). You will also need to add the Ghostscript bin
          directory after another semicolon to the system Path. (This will be the same as the lib directory, but ending
          in bin rather than lib — for example: <code>C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.16\bin</code>)
        </li>
        <li>
          In Windows 8.1/10, right-click on This PC, choose Properties > Advanced system settings > Advanced tab >
          Environment Variables. Scroll through the System variables in the bottom panel, and select Path, click Edit.
          This produces a list of existing paths. Click the "New" button, and you'll see a place at the bottom of the
          list to add your path.
          Add <code>C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.16\lib </code> (or whatever it is on your machine) to the list.
          You will also need to add the Ghostscript bin directory, which will be the same as the lib directory, but
          ending in bin rather than lib — for example: <code> C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.16\bin</code>. In Windows 10, for
          some reason, Inkscape sometimes doesn't like the paths at the bottom of the list. Near the "New" button are
          "Move Up" and "Move Down" buttons. So if you still can't open EPS files after installing Ghostscript, you can
          try moving the 2 paths up in the list. Try moving them up halfway or more.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that updating to a new version of Ghostscript will install to a new \gs directory, but will not erase the
        old version subdirectory or update the Environment Variables. You'll need to delete the old directories and
        adjust the Environment Variable paths if you want to make use of the newly installed version (with the new
        directory and paths).
